# MOBA game predictive analysis

MOBA is short for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. 

In this project, I used Python to extract JSON data from RiotAPI. 

APIGrabber.py was written by @farzatv. The rest is written by me. 

I also use R to create visualization and run logistic regression on the data, that will be posted soon.
